![this is an alternative](https://abnresource.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/ABN-Resource_Growth-Mindset-2.jpg)

#### we all might have heard about growth and fixed mindsets but what are they really? and how can it fix your life? 

##### lets talk about growth mindset because it's the important one 

<p> growth mindset is what's going to make you a productive person, positive person, and will make you look at things from different perspectives <p>
<p> how can you have a growth mindset? i'll talk a little about it and you can search for the rest. </p>
<p> our minds are a wonder arent they.. they are fascinating and they are what differentiate us from animals. </p>
<p> but if we're not paying enough attention we might make our minds work against us, thinking that we are smart and have the talent to do a lot of things when in reality we're fooling ourselves. we might have all of these but with lack of insipration we do nothing. </p>
